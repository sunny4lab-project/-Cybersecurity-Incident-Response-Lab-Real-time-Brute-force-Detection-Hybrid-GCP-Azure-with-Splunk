# üîê Cybersecurity Incident Response Lab: Real-time Brute-force Detection (Hybrid GCP & Azure) with Splunk

## üîç Overview

This project is a real-world hybrid cloud honeynet designed to capture and analyze brute-force login attempts targeting exposed RDP and SSH services. It uses Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to host intentionally vulnerable virtual machines. All security telemetry is ingested into a centralized Splunk SIEM deployed on GCP for monitoring, detection, and forensic analysis.
## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Architecture

**Azure:**
- Windows 10 VM (RDP enabled)

**GCP:**
- Ubuntu VM (SSH enabled)
- Splunk Enterprise Server

Real-world external attackers are allowed to interact with the exposed services. No synthetic traffic is generated‚Äîthis is purely threat actor-driven activity.

### 2. Install Splunk  
<details><summary>Details Here</summary>

Let's walk through the Splunk installation process step by step. Splunk is a powerful platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data. The process can vary slightly depending on your operating system, but I'll guide you through the basic installation on Linux and Windows.

‚úÖ 1. Download Splunk
For Linux (DEB):
- Visit the Splunk download page. ``https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download``
- Sign-in or create an account and it would give you access to the download page.

Choose the version for Linux (RPM/DEB) depending on your system architecture:

But for this Project I will be using DED for Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, etc.)

![Screenshot 2025-07-04 175645](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8ecdf25-4465-4f13-bcd2-90a87963ba22)


DEB-based (Ubuntu, Debian):
- Open a terminal. 
- Paste the deb command you copied : ``  sudo wget -O splunkforwarder-9.4.3-237ebbd22314-linux-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.4.3/linux/splunkforwarder-9.4.3-237ebbd22314-linux-amd64.deb" ``
- 
![Screenshot 2025-07-04 175245](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388c59c9-e090-4a7c-8e9e-9a2c952ff58f)

  
- Install the downloaded .deb package using dpkg. `` sudo dpkg -i ``

‚úÖ 2. Start Splunk
Linux:
1. After installation, you need to start Splunk from the command line. Go to the directory where Splunk is installed:

``cd /opt/splunk/bin``

2. Start Splunk:

   ``sudo ./splunk start --accept-license``

  - Important: The --accept-license flag ensures that you accept the Splunk license agreement.

  - Splunk will prompt you to create a username and password for the admin account.

    #
‚úÖ 3. Access Splunk Web Interface
Once Splunk is running, you can access the web interface to start configuring and using Splunk.

Open a web browser and navigate to:

For local installation: http://localhost:8000

For remote installation: http://<server-ip>:8000

You should be prompted to log in with the admin username and password you created during the installation process.

### 3. Install Splunk Universal Forwarder

#### On Windows (Azure VM):
- Install Sysmon
- Forward Security and Sysmon logs to Splunk

#### On Linux (GCP Ubuntu VM):
- Forward `/var/log/auth.log`

```ini
[monitor:///var/log/auth.log]
sourcetype = linux_secure
index = linux
```
